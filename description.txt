This mods aims to adds variations on the worldgen without ever enforcing them and trying to stay as close to vanilla worldgen as possible.

This mod includes ways to combine them with vanilla seeds and some custom ones so you can have both for the worthy and drunk world generation at the same time for example.
You can select the different seed option with the gear on the right of where the seed can be inputted in the world creation UI.
This mod also removes the vanilla way of triggering the secret seeds, so no seed will trigger a secret, they can only be enabled by the option UI.

An optional (but recommended) worldgen overhaul can be enabled in the mod options. 
It slightly changes the worldgen, but makes it way faster, especially on large worlds and fixes few things.

A custom world size is also worked on, it's already works pretty fine except few graphic bugs from vanilla.
The custom world option works better when the worldgen overhaul, and is even necessary in some cases.
Note that if you have a X/Y ratio too different from vanilla, the generation might look weird (for now at least).

This mod is compatible with nearly every mod and I try to fix them as soon as some issues are reported. 
However, there is a known issue with Calamity, but it should be fixed by them.
