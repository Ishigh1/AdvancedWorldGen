* ### A world where everything is a dungeon with different rooms

* ### A world where jungle spreads to the dirt, corruption, stone(making it lizhard ?)...

## Reversed world :
Main tiles are inverted : 

* Dungeon <-> Temple
* Snow <-> Desert
* Jungle <-> Mushroom
* Crimson <-> Corruption
* Lava -> Honey -> Water -> Lava

## Temple rework : 
* Temple is upside down
* Temple is 5 times bigger
* Rooms are not linear
* Traps not breakable before Golem is beaten
* Few mini temples

## Dark world :
* Everything is walled
* Light is dimmer
* Everything is considered as underground or deeper (for spawn purposes)
* Big columns with a world roof (maybe a surface at the space layer)

## (un)lucky worlds :
* Prefix rerolled to be better/worse (during play too)
* Affect character luck (of course)
* More/no pyramids
* More/less rare enemies
* Bigger/smaller and more common/rarer ore veins (also when altar broken)
* Impact biome chests ?

## Gravity world :
* Everything but the floating blocks can fall if not held
* Worldgen must verified to avoid floating things and some things should be added

## Halloween (unfinished) :
* Sneaky (but avoidable) traps (wires, pressure plates and pumps are invisible unless spectre googles are worn)
* Some graveyard
* Few mausoleum
* Dimmer light
* Tombstone and ground below need at least 45%(silver) pickaxe power (cant be blown up) or gravedigger
* Bosses have a ghost attack

### Purity world

### Hollow temple (hidden) :
* The temple becomes just one room

### Bigger temple rooms

### Make custom sized tile framing work

### Add more customized world options :
* Choose the ore tier (can be both)
* Choose temple/dungeon size modifier
* Choose height of layers
* Edit corruption size

### Finish editable passes

### Finish seed configuration (to only have part of a seed)
