This is a list of implemented things up to now :
- Inverted pyramid above the desert, with an house on it. The spawn is located threr
- All bunnies are named "Baba", enemies can't kill them, but if they die, they spawn a jungle turtle or the moon lord instead (for the explosive one)
- Brain of Corruption behaves like Eater of World should
- The surface is lower than usual on overhauled, to leave space to the many things above ground
